## API Client and Caching Strategy

The application uses a centralized API client that handles authentication, caching, and error handling:

```js
// frontend/src/utils/apiClient.js
```

### Key Features:

1. **Response Caching**: Short-term (30s) caching of API responses to reduce redundant network requests
2. **Auth Token Management**: Automatic inclusion of auth tokens in requests 
3. **Timeout Handling**: Default 10-second timeout for all requests
4. **AbortController Support**: Integration with AbortController for cancellation of requests
5. **Unified Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all API calls

### Usage Recommendations:

- Use the API client for all backend requests instead of direct Axios calls
- Set appropriate cache timeouts based on data volatility
- Clear specific cache entries when data is updated:

```js
// When updating a resource
await apiClient.post('/api/journal/entries', newEntry);
// Clear the cache for the related endpoints
apiClient.clearCache('/api/journal/entries');
```

## Loading States and Error Handling

The application includes a loading state management utility:

```js
// frontend/src/utils/useLoadingState.js
```

### Features:

1. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for long-running operations
2. **Automatic Retries**: Configurable retry logic for transient failures 
3. **Consistent UI States**: Unified approach to loading, error, and success states
4. **AbortController Integration**: Clean cancellation of in-flight requests

### Error Boundary Component:

```js
// frontend/src/components/ErrorBoundary.vue
```

Use this component to wrap sections of the UI that might fail, providing a graceful fallback:

```html
<ErrorBoundary @retry="retryOperation">
  <DashboardCard />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Dashboard Optimization

The dashboard is optimized to load data in parallel and provide visual feedback:

### Parallel Data Loading:

```js
// Load all dashboard sections in parallel
Promise.allSettled([
  fetchMoodData(),
  fetchChatData(),
  fetchJournalData(),
  fetchGoalsData()
]);
```

### Skeleton Loaders:

Skeleton loaders are used instead of spinner animations to provide visual structure during loading:

```html
<div v-if="loadingMood" class="space-y-4">
  <div class="skeleton w-40 h-10 rounded"></div>
  <div class="skeleton w-full h-24 rounded"></div>
</div>
```

### Optimization Tips:

1. Keep card components small and focused
2. Use `v-once` for static content that doesn't change
3. Implement pagination for lists that might grow large
4. Use `shallowRef` for large data objects that don't need reactivity in their properties

## Image Optimization

### Profile Image Uploads:

1. **Client-side Validation**: Validate file type and size before upload
2. **Image Compression**: Consider adding client-side compression for large images
3. **Progressive Loading**: Use progressive loading for images

### Best Practices:

1. Specify width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts
2. Use appropriate image formats (WebP where supported)
3. Implement lazy loading for images below the fold:

```html
<img loading="lazy" src="..." alt="..." />
```

## Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

Vue Router supports lazy loading components, reducing the initial bundle size:

```js
// router/index.js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/journal',
    component: () => import('../views/JournalView.vue')
  }
]
```

Consider lazy loading:
- Large components not needed on first render
- Feature-specific components
- Admin or settings sections

## Backend Optimizations

### API Endpoint Optimization:

1. **Query Optimization**: Ensure Firestore queries use proper indexes
2. **Data Limiting**: Always limit the amount of data returned by endpoints
3. **Compression**: Enable gzip/Brotli compression for responses

### Firebase Optimization:

1. **Offline Persistence**: Consider enabling offline capabilities for better user experience
2. **Batched Writes**: Use batched writes for multiple document updates
3. **Security Rules**: Optimize security rules to avoid excessive reads

## Monitoring and Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track:

1. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: How long until the user can interact with the page
2. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: First rendering of any content
3. **API Response Times**: Track backend performance
4. **Error Rates**: Monitor application errors

### Tools:

1. **Lighthouse**: Regular audits of key pages
2. **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: For monitoring real-user metrics
3. **Error Tracking**: Integration with error tracking service

## Additional Performance Tips

1. **Virtualized Lists**: For long scrollable lists, use virtualization to render only visible items
2. **Web Workers**: Offload heavy computation to web workers
3. **Preloading**: Preload likely navigation paths:

```js
// Preload the journal page when hovering over its link
onMouseover: () => import('../views/JournalView.vue')
```

4. **Service Workers**: Consider implementing a service worker for offline capabilities and faster subsequent loads

By implementing these strategies, the Mental Wellness application will provide a fast, responsive user experience across all devices and network conditions.
